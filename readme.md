# Hackerrank Exercises

These are mostly scratch files used to develop and tests solutions to Hackerrank challanges. I use Visual Studio Code to debug the Node scripts and Pry or Byebug to debug Ruby. Local `launch.json` files are used to launch scripts in debug mode, though I'm considering switching to `package.json` to allow consistency outside of VS Code.
